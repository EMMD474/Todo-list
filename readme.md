# This is a simple todi-list app with a graphical user inter that simply allows a user to type in the name of the item they want to add to the list and it add it.

# There are a few things that still need to be worked on in the near future, such as:

# connecting the todo-list to a working database

# being able to remove item from the todo-list

# when adding an item to the list, it should be able to check if the item being added is already there or not, if it is there, it should display a msg"item already on list" else: add item to list and update database.
