# There are a few things that will need to be worked on in the near future, such as:

# connecting the todo-list to a working database

# being able to remove item from the todo-list

# when adding an item to the list, it should be able to check if the item being added is already there or not, if it is there, it should display a msg"item already on list" else: add item to list and update database.
